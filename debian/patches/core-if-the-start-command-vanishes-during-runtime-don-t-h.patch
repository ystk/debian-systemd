Subject: core: if the start command vanishes during runtime don't hit an
 assert

This can happen when the configuration is changed and reloaded while we are
executing a service. Let's not hit an assert in this case.

Fixes: #4444
(cherry picked from commit 47fffb3530af3e3ad4048570611685635fde062e)
